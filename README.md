# KaxhyapUI

> ⚠️ **Beta**  
> KaxhyapUI is currently in beta. APIs are not frozen and may change before v1.0.0.

**KaxhyapUI** is an open-source **SwiftUI components library** designed for Apple’s **Liquid Glass design language**, targeting **iOS 26 and macOS 26**.

The library provides **modern, reusable SwiftUI components** built using the latest system APIs, intentionally avoiding legacy UI patterns and backward compatibility.
